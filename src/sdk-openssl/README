The built versions for the different platforms are kept in the repo to make simple
changes to the Corona OpenSSL plugin easier.

Building a new version OpenSSL
==============================

Android

	Edit openssl_android/build-libssl.sh to indicate the required version of OpenSSL
	Run it (build products are placed in ./android where they'll be found by the plugin build)

Apple

	Edit openssl_apple/build-libssl.sh to indicate the required version of OpenSSL
	Run it (build products are placed in ./apple where they'll be found by the plugin build)

Windows

	Find built versions of Windows libraries (e.g. from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) and place them in the ./win32 directory in the appropriate locations
